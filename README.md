# cello

This is a KBase wrapper for CIDAR LAB's program Cello.

Information regarding base plasmid choices:

If you choose "None" as your Base Plasmid, the program will only return a circuit.

If you choose "E-Coli" as your Base Plasmid, then the program will run using Eco1C1G1T0 as its UCF, and it will perform all the simulations.

If you choose "Custom" as your base plasmid, be sure to give both the sensor and the circuit plasmid as inputs to the program; the output plasmid is optional.
